# Need Help?

If you need help on what a command does just do `t!help [command name]`, if you still don't understand it just join the [support server](https://discord.gg/HefqX38FgK), you can leave right after you get help because it's main purpose is only to help or if you think you might need more help you're free to stay.

On the other hand you can join the [community server](https://discord.gg/fhrAFuEBQ8) and you're not allowed to leave, if you leave the curse of mary will be placed on you hahaha, Im kidding relax.

# Bugs

The bot gets updated everyday therefore bugs are most likely to show up. Damn bugs 🙄. Unfortunety there is no command that can allow you to send quick bug reports yet so you can just join the [support server](https://discord.gg/HefqX38FgK) and make your report :)
